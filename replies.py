    "k": "K? K what? The letter before L? The letter after J? Did you know that in JK the K stands for “kidding?” So your reply is “kidding?” or K as in Potassium? Do you need some Special K for breakfast? K as in I can K/O you? Can I knock you out and feed you to sharks? Sharks have a K in it. \"K\"? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is \"K\"? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only letter you can comprehend is \"K\" - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, I'll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proofread by several professors of literature. Don't believe me? I doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be \"K\" once again. Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about a single letter? I bet you took the time to type that one letter too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing \"send\". You're so fucking pathetic. I'm honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? Nothing. I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a response. Do you want \"K\" on your gravestone? Do you want people to remember you as the asshat who one day decided to respond to someone with a single letter? \"Hey, look, everybody! It's that \"K\" guy!\" That's who you are. You're going to be known as the \"K\" guy. How does it feel? Do you feel happy? Quite honestly, I don't care, which is why I'm not even going to respond to you. Goodbye, idiot."
